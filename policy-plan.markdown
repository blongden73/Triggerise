title: Policy Plan
date: 2020-07-28 11:50:00 Z
Body: "Triggerise Stichting (the Foundation) is a non-profit institution for the public
  benefit (ANBI), as is apparent from the Foundation’s statutes in the Triggerise
  Stichting Articles of Incorporation and from the actual work planned and implemented
  by the Foundation.\n\n**Activities and Work by the Foundation**\n\nThe disposition
  of Triggerise Sitchting’s assets are made in accordance with its objectives, which
  include creating, fostering, investing and/or managing businesses and philanthropic
  solutions to underserved market segments worldwide. The foundation’s mission and
  vision are as follows:\n\n**Vision:** To digitally engage underserved individuals
  in order to radically scale health and wellbeing impact.\n\n**Mission:** Our digital
  platform nudges individuals to adopt and maintain positive behaviours by enabling
  access to products, services and information.\n\nWe facilitate online and offline
  interactions between our users and ecosystem partners in the most innovative and
  cost effective way.\n\nWe use data, insights and behavioural economics to constantly
  evolve with our client’s needs and provide them with personalised choices that deliver
  better health & well-being outcomes.\n\nThe Foundation shall realize its objections,
  mission, and vision by raising funds and donations; managing and using such funds
  through investments into and/or donations to various initiatives worldwide; and
  consulting, supporting and cooperating with organisations, individuals and institutions.\n\nAs
  described in its mission, the focus of the Foundation’s implementation is its digital
  platform. Like other digital platforms, Triggerise develops technology and partnerships
  that provide access to content, products and services – in this case, with the goal
  of motivating positive behaviour. In practice, this means that Triggerise partners
  with demand creators and links the people they reach to service providers. This
  allows Triggerise to attribute impact to demand creators, pay partners based on
  performance, and use rewards and other behavioral nudges to make it easier for users
  to make positive choices. \n\n**Fundraising: Recruitment and Management of Funds**\n\nThe
  Foundation raises funds for the benefit of its objectives through donations, awards,
  gifts, cost reimbursements, and/or grants. The Foundation writes proposals for funds
  provided by multilateral funders, bilateral foundations, private foundations, other
  non-profit organizations and for-profit companies. In 2018, Triggerise Stichting
  raised €4,531,886, more than three times as much as it did two years ago. This success
  is largely due to the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, whose funding accounts
  for 56% of our revenue, compared to the Netherlands’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs
  (as well as associated Embassies of the Kingdom of The Netherlands – EKN) at 36%,
  and other funders at 6%.\n\n**Capacity Spending of the Foundation**\n\nIncome received
  is administered as follows:\n\nTriggerise Stichting involves its 100% subsidiary
  and management company, Triggerise BV, established in Amsterdam, in the fulfillment
  of its activities. Triggerise BV implements Triggerise’s digital platform with the
  support of its subsidiaries, including Triggerise Kenya, Triggerise India, Triggerise
  South Africa, Triggerise Malawi, Triggerise Tanzania, and Triggerise Labs (a Portugal-based
  subsidiary that employs Triggerise’s software development team). In addition to
  Triggerise BV, Triggerise Ethiopia is a subsidiary of Triggerise Stichting (due
  to Ethiopian legal requirements).\n\nRevenue will be managed and controlled by the
  Board of the Foundation in accordance with its charter. The related costs of the
  Foundation should be in reasonable proportion to achieve the best outcomes for the
  benefit of the objectives of the Foundation and the objectives of its related work
  programs or projects.\n\nAfter paying creditors, Triggerise Stichting must spend
  any remaining capital for the benefit of an organization with similar objectives.\n\n**Cost
  Structure**\n\nCost drivers include project management and implementation salaries,
  travel expenses, management costs, and programmatic costs (including the nudges
  Triggerise uses to motivate behaviour). Further costs include building, maintaining,
  and applying the software that powers Triggerise’s platform.\n\n**Management of
  the Foundation**\n\nPursuant to the Foundation’s Articles of Incorporation and its
  actual activities, no individual person or legal entity shall have decisive control.
  Thus no individual person or legal entity can dispose of the Institution’s assets
  as if they were their own.\n\nOn the basis of Article 8 of the Articles of Incorporation
  (provision regarding the decision-making by the executive board and supervisory
  board) and its actual efficacy has no person with decisive influence within the
  Foundation.\n\nThe Supervisory Board shall elect a chairperson, a secretary and
  a treasurer from among its midst. The Supervisory Board consists of six members
  and is chaired by Lisa Simutami.\n\n**Administration and Oversight**\n\nThe administration
  of Triggerise Stichting, the preparation of the annual accounts and the account
  oversight is managed by NielenVanDeLar accountants BV. Triggerise Stichting uses
  the Netsuite ERP to track expenses and income and allocate to funders/projects.\n\n**Remuneration
  Policy**\n\nTriggerise Stichting does not have employees and its board members do
  not receive any compensation.\n\n**Current Projects**\n\nTriggerise Stichting is
  currently implementing projects in Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
  Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Uganda and the United States. During 2020-2023, Triggerise
  Stichting will shift to an operating model that facilitates growth within these
  countries and to others – primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia."
