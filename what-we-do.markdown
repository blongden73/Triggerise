Supporting-title: Making big impact possible
Description: "### Young people across Africa and India are using our Tiko platform
  to make positive life decisions. We connect our members' needs to existing local
  providers, by building ecosystems of local health services, community organisations
  and micro-entrepreneurs. With this diversity of actors we’re able to create impact
  at scale.  \n\nPowered by behavioural economics, we use nudge tools including reminders,
  follow-ups, subsidies and instant rewards to motivate our members. From manicures
  to contraceptives, Tiko offers a broad range of wellbeing products and services
  to foster long-lasting healthy behaviours. Currently we connect primarily adolescent
  girls and young mothers to a variety of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services
  and antenatal care (ANC) from local providers."

What-section-one-title: Thriving Ecosystems | Big impact
What-section-one-description: "Tiko connects across supply and demand, building networks
  of donors, local services and communities to deliver joined-up health services on
  the ground. \n\nOur ecosystems are made up of highly diverse actors, from pharmacies
  to beauty salons to local shops.  Being connected through our platform means that
  each supplier can do what they do even better and are rewarded for it. It also allows
  us to integrate multiple programmes into one, so Tiko can offer anything from medical
  consultations to contraceptives, STI test-kits to vocational training to motivate
  our members.\n\nThrough our role as a connector, we ensure our services are relevant
  and we boost local economies wherever we go. Our signature ecosystem approach means
  we leverage expertise, funds and infrastructure to scale fast. \n\nOur ecosystems
  are at varying stages of maturity from nascent projects in Burkino Faso to established
  programmes in India. In Kenya for example, we are currently operating 145 such ecosystems
  which have helped us serve 268,226 adolescent girls with contraceptive products
  and services, in just the last two and a half years - making it one of the most
  impactful health programmes in East Africa (ITH impact report, 2015-2019).\n"
What-section-two-title: Motivated Choices | Better futures
What-section-two-description: |-
  Our platform connects members to a range of health and wellbeing offers to explore on their own terms. Accessible to everyone, everywhere in high tech (mobile app), low tech (SMS service) and no tech (membership card), Tiko also motivates members to adopt positive behaviours with behavioural nudges.

  Our financial nudges can be discount offers on healthcare services and rewards to spend locally. Non-financial nudges vary from social support to peer referral, gamification to digital and offline reminders.

  Our conversion rate of 89%\* reassures us that our offers are motivating for our members and that this is a model where our members are making decisions on their own terms.

  With real agency to choose, Tiko inspires lasting good habits while boosting local economies.

What-section-three-title: Agile Programmes | Effective outcomes
What-section-three-description: "Using the real-time data generated from member interactions,
  user ratings and customer surveys, we measure our impact quantitatively. We evaluate
  how effective our incentives are and gain valuable insights into the behavioural
  trends of our members. \n\nOur donors have access to our dashboard and have day-to-day
  visibility of our programmes. It means we can collaborate to increase positive impact
  at any given time. This gives us agility, offers transparency and delivers trust
  across the ecosystem, while making our resources more efficient and our work more
  relevant."
Summary-title: Our model
Summarty-text: Our Tiko model delivers a new way to collaborate, a better way to motivate
  young people and a more efficient way to manage programmes. All this means more
  impact at scale and at a lower cost. We trigger change, for good.
