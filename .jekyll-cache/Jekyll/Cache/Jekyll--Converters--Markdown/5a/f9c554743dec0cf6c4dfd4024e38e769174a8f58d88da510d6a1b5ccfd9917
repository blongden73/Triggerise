Funded by the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), In Their Hands (ITH) project has connected 319,228 girls to 336,931 SRH services and products across Kenya in 3 years. We built 145 ecosystems in 19 counties of Kenya. These ecosystems are made of pharmacies, retailers, on-the-ground mobilisers and clinics, jointly aiming to improve the sexual and reproductive health and prevent unwanted pregnancies for 15-19 year old girls.
Our approach towards this objective has been of iterative improvements - learning from the data our members generate and feeding it back into our platform to make it more user-centric every step forward. Access to real-time data and further drawing insights from interactive dashboards based on this data allowed us to improve our platforms in three ways –</p>
<ul>
  <li>Optimising nudges based on member behaviour</li>
  <li>Addressing risk management issues</li>
  <li>Maintaining the quality and relevance of services offered</li>
</ul>

<p>The visibility into the real-time performance of our interventions brings transparency and agility to our programme. Making every actor and member accountable and also providing evidence of impact on a real-time basis has offered complete transparency to our donors on the operations and performance of the programme. Simultaneously, accessible insights also facilitate collaborative and agile decision-making by the stakeholders that are required for continuous fine-tuning of complex interventions like this; elevating donor relationship to a partner relationship. 
ITH has been our flagship programme that demonstrated that relevant impact at scale is possible by deploying technology and behavioural sciences principles.</p>
